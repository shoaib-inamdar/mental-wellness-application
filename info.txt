##types of data types
=>
    int 
    BigInt ->for bigger integer value
    String ->for string
    var ->takes the first value assigned to it as it type;
    ===>> eg. var a= "hello";
              a=12;--> this will give an error and will say that the variable is string type not int type
                ==> (this is possible only if it is given value on its initialization)
        but if it declared and initialized later then it can take any value in run time 
        eg. var a;
        a=21;
        a="shoaib";
        a=1.4;
        >>>all this is possible and it will not show any error
    double ->for decimal value
    num ->for both decimal and integer
    bool ->for true or false
